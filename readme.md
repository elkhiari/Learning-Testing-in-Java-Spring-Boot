## Introduction
Welcome to the Java Spring Boot Testing Roadmap! This guide will help you master the essentials of testing in Spring Boot and provide a hands-on project for practical experience.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Java and Spring Boot.
- IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or any other of your choice) installed.
- Maven or Gradle installed.

## Roadmap

### 1. Basics of Testing
Understand the importance of testing in software development. Learn about different types of testing: unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

### 2. JUnit
Learn the basics of writing JUnit tests. Understand annotations like `@Test`, `@Before`, `@After`, `@BeforeClass`, and `@AfterClass`. Write simple unit tests for your Java classes.

### 3. Spring Testing Annotations
Learn about Spring's testing support annotations. Explore annotations like `@SpringBootTest`, `@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)`, `@MockBean`, and `@Autowired`.

### 4. Mockito
Understand the basics of mocking and how to use Mockito. Write tests with mocked dependencies using `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks`.

### 5. Integration Testing
Learn to write integration tests for your Spring Boot applications. Use `@SpringBootTest` for loading the entire application context. Explore the `TestRestTemplate` or `@WebMvcTest` for testing web controllers.

### 6. Spring Data JPA Testing
Understand how to test Spring Data JPA repositories. Use `@DataJpaTest` annotation for testing JPA components.

### 7. Spring Boot Test Slices
Learn about test slices like `@WebMvcTest`, `@DataJpaTest`, and `@JsonTest`. Understand when to use each type of test slice.

### 8. Test Profiles
Learn how to use Spring profiles for testing. Use `@ActiveProfiles` to activate specific profiles during tests.

### 9. Test Driven Development (TDD)
Practice Test Driven Development by writing tests before implementing the actual code. Understand the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

### 10. CI/CD
Integrate your tests into a CI/CD pipeline. Learn about tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

### 11. Advanced Testing Topics
Explore advanced testing topics like parameterized tests, test lifecycle, and custom annotations. Learn about code coverage tools like JaCoCo.

### 12. Security Testing
Understand how to perform security testing in Spring Boot applications. Learn about tools like OWASP ZAP or dependency checkers.

### 13. Performance Testing
Explore tools and techniques for performance testing in Spring Boot.

### 14. Monitoring and Logging
Learn how to incorporate monitoring and logging in your tests.

### 15. Documentation Testing
Explore tools like Spring Rest Docs for testing and documenting APIs.

### 16. Project Work
Apply your knowledge by working on a small Spring Boot project and writing comprehensive tests for it.

## Small Project: Task Manager

### Project Overview
Create a simple Task Manager application using Spring Boot. The application should allow users to:
- Create, update, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- View a list of tasks.

### Project Structure
task-manager/
|-- src/
| |-- main/
| | |-- java/
| | | |-- com.example.taskmanager/
| | | | |-- controller/
| | | | | |-- TaskController.java
| | | | |-- model/
| | | | | |-- Task.java
| | | | |-- repository/
| | | | | |-- TaskRepository.java
| | | | |-- service/
| | | | | |-- TaskService.java
| | |-- resources/
| | |-- application.properties
|-- src/
| |-- test/
| | |-- java/
| | | |-- com.example.taskmanager/
| | | | |-- controller/
| | | | | |-- TaskControllerTest.java
| | | | |-- service/
| | | | | |-- TaskServiceTest.java



### Tasks
1. Set up a Spring Boot project using your preferred build tool (Maven or Gradle).
2. Create a `Task` entity with `id`, `description`, and `completed` fields.
3. Implement a `TaskRepository` for database interaction.
4. Create a `TaskService` to handle business logic.
5. Develop a `TaskController` for handling HTTP requests.
6. Write unit tests for `TaskService` using JUnit and Mockito.
7. Write integration tests for `TaskController` using Spring's testing annotations.
8. Implement a basic frontend (optional) or use tools like Postman to test your API endpoints.
9. Integrate your project with a CI tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
10. Implement logging and monitoring in your application.

### Learning Objectives
- Apply unit testing and mocking techniques with JUnit and Mockito.
- Understand and use Spring testing annotations for integration testing.
- Practice writing tests for Spring Data JPA repositories.
- Implement test profiles and test-driven development.
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing.
- Explore logging and monitoring tools.
